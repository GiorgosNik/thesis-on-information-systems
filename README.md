# Thesis On Information Systems
The current project consists of a team effort and research on Cloud Computing models. More precisely, we dived into the concept of "as a Service" and tried to include as much possible information regarding the importance, drawbacks, and differences of these models. The concepts we explore are briefly described below.
## The need for Information Systems
We examine the purpose and the importance of information systems in relation to the rapidly changing demands of the modern age, discussing their usefulness to various organizations and to society in general.

## Cloud Models
We examine various cloud models, noting their pros and cons, mentioning the most popular examples and describe the scenarios in which they are useful. We cover the following models:
- Software as a Service
- Platform as a Service
- Infrastructure as a Service
- Function as a Service
- Backend as a Service
- Database as a Service

## Comparison and Conclusion 
We compare the above mentioned models and draw conclusions regarding their usefulness to different organizations.
